        I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), where my research focuses on long-tail learning and dataset distillation. I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, majoring in Computer Science, from the School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence at Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU).
        <br></br>
        
        My interests include machine learning and electronic DIY. During my undergraduate years, I worked on several projects involving smart car design and programming, which sparked my lasting passion for embedded systems and hands-on development.
